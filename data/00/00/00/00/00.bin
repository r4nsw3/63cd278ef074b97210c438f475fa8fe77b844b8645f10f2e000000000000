  |   A few of our hardcore fans requested the ability to bonk oneself,     |
  |   which can come in handy when going for a perfect, if you miss a       |
  |   gold or gem.                                                          |

  |   In reviewing our leaderboards and competing with our fans, we         |
  |   realized two very lame bugs were gimping everyone's scores! So we     |
  |   fixed those, and also made some tweaks based on peoples' Difficulty   |
  |   Settings...                                                           |

  |   Added input buffering to mitigate input lag when playing with         |
  |   various wireless controllers on various platforms.                    |
  |                                                                         |
  |   Made all character moves available from the start of the game-no      |
  |   more having to unlock them in order!                                  |
  |                                                                         |
  |   Made the jump and avoid enemies/obstacles more forgiving.             |
  |                                                                         |
  |   Added more on-screen communication regarding the Impossible Levels,   |
  |   the Retro Levels, and the overall difficulty of the game.             |
  |                                                                         |
  |   Added a "break" sound effect to kickwalls in addition to their        |
  |   musical tone.                                                         |
  |                                                                         |

  |                                                                         |
